inlibrary*1*You walk into a library, although the only books on the shelves are labeled 'Stranger's Family History' with a volume number. One of the books is lying on the ground, open.

Written beneath the panel are the words 'look up'.
inlounge*1*You use the chair leg to pry the door up. It is very heavy so you keep the leg there to hold it up. When you walk in the room, a horrid smell fills the air. There is an oil lamp on in the corner, shining dimly. This room is a lounge of some sort, and you notice that the couch in the middle has a deteriorating human body. You also notice that there is a TV in the room, which is the first sign of sophistication you have come across so far. You hear a cracking sound.

vent*screwdriver*You look in the vent and find the key card. It is too hard for you to reach. *You opened the vent and took the key card. 
inorchard*1*You open the door with the card and walk into an orchard. Heat lamps give light and heat to the room which is a relief after being in the freezer for so long. There is a console in the middle of the room. The door slams shut behind you, and a timer starts ticking. You find the location of the timer, it is ticking on the top of the console and says you have 3 minutes left. *You are in the orchard.

console*code*You go up to the console. The screen asks for the password. *The room starts to get very hot. The screen says 'That was just the beginning.' It now asks for 'The last three from a product of four.' *You entered the second code correctly. The plants catch fire, and and the room starts to get very hot. It now asks 'The final question is: How old was John Stranger at the time of his death?' Remember that you can still read your notes. *The final code has been entered and the sprinklers turn on. A panel beneath the console flips up exposing a bomb. It displays that the time left is: 
finale*None*BOOOOOOOOM!!! The bomb explodes, and the shock wave is deafening. The freezer starts to feel warmer. You can hear falling rocks outside, but they are silenced in a short amount of time. You walk out of the freezer and see that the way for your escape has been cleared. The debris from the collapsed tunnel has been cleared and you can see light at the end of a long tunnel. You have done it! You have escaped. *BOOOOM!!! The bomb is deafening. When your ears adjust you can hear debris falling outside. The noise settles and you walk out to see the damage. The orchard has been demolished, and the rooms surrounding are inaccessible. It is very dark and the torches down the hall are burnt out. You go to see if the path has been cleared by the explosion, but have no luck. You are now trapped here forever. *BOOOOM!!! The explosion is deafening and makes Mr. Moodles go crazy. After a few moments you go out. The path has been cleared and you can see daylight at the end of the tunnel. Mr. Moodles turns to you. He says "Congratulations! You have escaped. You are now free to explore the world outside. I really wish I could have given the same congratulations to your parents, Thomas. I'm sure they would be proud of you." Mr. Moodles darts off into the light. It's takes you a few moments to digest this newfound information, but you eventually collect yourself and run off to seek revenge. *BOOOOM!!! The explosion is deafening and makes Mr. Moodles go crazy. You walk out after a few moments and see that the path was not cleared. Mr. Moodles turns to you and says "You are a total failure. I had high hopes for you but in the end you only manage to disappoint. Your parents would have been very upset with you, Thomas." Mr. Moodles knocks you over and breaks your neck. You feel a tingling sensation in your stomach and realize that he is likely very hungry. You have failed to escape and are now being eaten by a genetically modified monkey.
